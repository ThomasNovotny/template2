  description:  "The 1st input and the 1st output is connected to an inverter. The 2nd and 3rd input and the 2nd and 3rd output is connected to an AND-gate. The 3rd and 4th inputs and the 3rd and 4th output is connected to an OR-gate. The last 2 inputs and the 2nd-last output is connected to an Earle-latch, where the last input bit is the Enable-signal."      # One line description of what your project does
